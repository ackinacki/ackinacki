/// @title TokenContract (streaming deal / `token_contract` per spec §3-4)
/// @notice One streaming inference deal between one seller (owner) and one
///         buyer. Payment is in ECC[2] SHELL, escrowed in this contract;
///         identities/locks ride on PrivateNotes (model B).
///
///         CONSUMPTION MODEL. The first tick is a PROBE: frozen at `open()`, owed to nobody, and
///         nothing is claimable until `acceptProbe` takes it (§3.1.2). Past that the escrow stays
///         whole until the seller CLAIMS consumption (`claimTokens`, cumulative from zero — the
///         probe is its first tick), and the seller posts the mirror `SELLER_BOND` (2P,
///         `_bondAmount()`, §4.2) before `open()`. There is no prepaid/frozen buffer beyond the
///         probe: a claim earns money by outliving its own window, not by being paid in advance.
///         A THREE-DEEP pipeline carries the claim, all in cumulative TOKENS so remainders survive
///         (56 then 33 is 89, nothing lost to rounding): one FINAL figure, which is the only one
///         money is computed from, and two PENDING claims. A fresh claim advances the pipeline by
///         one; `finalize()` drains it once `CLAIM_PROMOTE_WINDOW` passes with no dispute — which
///         is what makes the LAST claim payable, since nothing supersedes it. The seller may thus
///         run up to two ticks ahead of what he can be paid for: exactly the old two-tick exposure
///         bound, which is why the bond stays 2P mirroring it.
///
///         Claims are bounded twice: `MIN_CLAIM_INTERVAL` between them, and `MIN_SECONDS_PER_TICK`
///         on how much output the elapsed time can justify — one tick per minute, the ceiling no
///         model on the market can beat (fastest known: 1M tokens in ~58.8 s).
///
///         ONE contract, two settlements, selected by the deal flags the book hands down at match:
///           - ORDINARY deal (`subWeeks == 0`): pay by FACT — trusted ticks x price, the rest of
///             the escrow returns to the buyer. Time is irrelevant.
///           - SUBSCRIPTION (`subWeeks > 0`): TAKE-OR-PAY — each week boundary credits the whole
///             weekly quota regardless of consumption (`settleWeek`), because what was bought is
///             reserved availability. Consumption tracking exists for the dispute path only.
///
///         DISPUTE (§4.2) reaches ONLY the contested delta `claimed - trusted`; everything trusted
///         is beyond reach, exactly as a finalized tick was. What it reaches is DESTROYED, not
///         handed over — on the concession branch as much as on the timeout. The buyer gets back
///         the weeks the term never started and nothing more, which is what `stop()` returns too,
///         so disputing never refunds him more than simply ending the deal; it costs him `D` on
///         top, staked from the bond he posted beside the escrow. What it buys him is that the
///         seller collects only for what his claims prove. The timeout differs in one thing: it
///         burns an equal `D` from the seller's bond as well, which is what keeps agreeing his
///         cheaper branch. Notes are never locked — all economics live here.
///
///         Lifecycle:
///         1. `fund()`/`fundFromOrderBook()` — buyer escrows SHELL; the buyer
///                             note pubkey is recorded (spec §2.3/§3.1.1).
///         1b.`fundDeal(amount)` — the one funding door: the seller's note sends gas as
///             attached ECC[2] and the `SELLER_BOND` mirror bond (2P) as a figure.
///         2. `open(cipher)` — seller posts the endpoint encrypted to the
///                             buyer's pubkey and freezes the probe tick;
///                             state = `Probe`. The note is NOT locked.
///         3. `claimTokens()` — seller reports cumulative consumption (rate-limited).
///         3c.`finalize()`   — permissionless: promote pending claims after the window.
///         3b.`settleWeek()` — subscription only: permissionless weekly take-or-pay credit.
///         4a.`stop()`       — buyer exit; settles trusted ticks, refunds the rest. Also the
///                             seller-no-show path: silence leaves his last claim unpromoted.
///         4b.`dispute()`    — buyer contests the delta;
///                             `releaseDispute()` / `resolveDisputeTimeout()`.
///         5. `withdrawShell`/`destroy` — seller pulls finalized SHELL (§3.5).

    // never work. A mint draws on the DAPP CONFIG of the dapp the contract lives in; a
    // TokenContract is deployed by an EXTERNAL message into its OWN dapp, and that dapp has no
    // config, so there was nothing for it to draw on. Every other contract in this tree carries the
    // same three lines and, living in a configured dapp, is genuinely self-sufficient — which is
    // why the deal's copy read as ordinary boilerplate and survived this long. The check was also
    // the last place this contract asked the ACCOUNT how much it had; everything the deal owns is
    // now `_balance`, a number, and nothing here consults native balance at all.
    //
    // A deal is GAS-FED BY ITS FUNDER instead: `fundDeal` arrives with ECC[2] attached under flag
    // 17 (16 = convert the sent token, 1 = fees on the sender), which lands as vmshell. One call,
    // two effects — gas on the account, money on `_balance`. That is also why the funding entries
    // never read `msg.currencies`: by the time the body runs the ECC has already become native
    // balance, and the money is the argument, not the currency.

    // EVERY `selfdestruct` IN THIS FILE DISPOSES OF `_balance` ON ITS OWN LINE, in the function
    // that destructs. There was a `_sweepBalance(to)` helper here and it is gone on purpose: a
    // reader looking at a wind-down has to see where the money went without following a call, and
    // an irreversible operation should not hide its disposal behind a name.
    //
    // WHY THE DISPOSAL HAS TO BE WRITTEN AT ALL (generation 4.0.33). `selfdestruct` used to be a
    // sweep for free: the deal's SHELL was ECC on the account, so destroying the account carried
    // whatever was left to the payout address, and a wind-down could end on `selfdestruct` without
    // saying anything about money. `_balance` is a variable. It does not travel. Destroying the
    // contract with a non-zero `_balance` pays nobody — it annihilates the figure, silently, with
    // no failed call and nothing in a log.
    //
    // A residual is not hypothetical, though the way it arises has narrowed. Payouts no longer come
    // home — `bounce: false`, and there is no handler to catch them — so the old source is gone.
    // What remains is arithmetic: rounding on the fee split, a figure zeroed in one earmark and
    // handed on through `_balance`, an amount below what any path pays out. Small, and none of it
    // owned by anyone the contract can name, which is exactly why the sweep is explicit.
    //
    // The rule each site follows: THE RESIDUAL GOES WHERE THE DESTRUCT'S OWN PAYEE GOES, because
    // that is what residual ECC did by itself. `cleanupUnopened` is the single exception and says
    // so at length: it pays TWO parties, so a residual there has no identifiable owner.

    //
    //   probe phase (trial tick not accepted):
    //     stop()            probe tick burned, mirror tick burned from the bond
    //     sellerStop()      mirror tick burned from the bond; the trial tick goes back to the buyer
    //     dispute -> either D = one tick (the floor), burned; timeout burns the mirror too
    //
    //   after the probe:
    //     stop()            weeks through the one IN PROGRESS + trusted claims
    //     sellerStop()      weeks that ENDED only + trusted claims   (the seller quit mid-week)
    //     dispute -> either the buyer pays what stop() would cost him, PLUS D. The seller collects
    //                       only what his claims prove for the disputed week; the unearned rest of
    //                       it is burned, not refunded, and the timeout burns his D as well.
    //
    // The rule: no door out is cheaper than `stop()`. A dispute takes no evidence and its moment
    // is freely chosen, so the instant it settles for less than the ordinary exit it stops being
    // about the service and becomes the way to shed the bill — `D` is capped at 2P by spec while a
    // weekly quota runs to thousands of ticks, so "charge fewer weeks on the dispute path" is never
    // a small difference. `sellerStop` is the one asymmetry, and it runs the other way: the seller
    // forgoes the week he walked out of.
    //
    // The rule binds `sellerStop` on the trial too, which is why leaving during it has a price at
    // all. A price only one door charges is not a price: whoever finds the free door takes it, and
    // pre-probe there is no started week for `sellerStop` to forgo, so its own asymmetry has
    // nothing to bite on yet. The seller therefore burns a tick of bond whichever side ends the
    // trial. The trial tick itself does NOT follow him: it is the buyer's until acceptance, so it
    // burns only when the buyer is the one walking away from a service he asked to try, and
    // returns with the escrow when the seller is. Destroying it on the seller's exit would hand
    // him a grief worth exactly what it cost him — he opens the stream, leaves at once, and the
    // buyer's tick goes with him.
